A bridge that allows you to control your Bluetooth-capable Philips Hue lights via HomeKit.

## Setup

### Install

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-wheel avahi-utils
git clone https://github.com/alexhorn/laemp.git
cd laemp
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Pair your lamp

1. Use the Hue BT app to factory-reset your light. Otherwise it will refuse to bond to your computer.
2. Open the bluetoothctl shell:
   ```
   sudo bluetoothctl
   ```
3. Start the discovery:
   ```
   scan on
   ```
4. Write down the MAC address of your light.
5. Pair to your light:
   ```
   pair [MAC address]
   trust [MAC address]
   ```
6. Done, you can now pair the light to your phone again.


### Add the bridge to the Home app

1. Run from a terminal (you either need to use *sudo* or *setcap* to access Bluetooth):
   ```
   sudo ./venv/bin/python3 hap_bridge.py
   ```
2. Open the *Home* app and tap *Add device*.
3. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.


## Compatibility

Works on Raspbian Buster.

Sometimes it also works on Windows 10 20H2, but it is very flaky.
